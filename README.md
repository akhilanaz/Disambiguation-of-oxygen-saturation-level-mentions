# Disambiguation-of-oxygen-saturation-level-mentions

Identifying patients based on the oxygen saturation requirement is an important focus in COVID-19 research. Physicians formulated the necessity for computerised classifiers for COVID-19 patient discharge summaries to identify those without supplemental oxygen in order to avoid the labour-intensive process of reviewing extensive medical records.

We analysed the text snippets extracted from anonymised COVID-19 patient discharge summaries in German to perform a binary classification task, characterised by differentiating patients who received oxygen supplementation and those who did not. Various machine learning algorithms, including classical ML to deep learning models, were compared, along with data visualisation. Classifier decisions are explained using LIME, which illustrate the model decisions.
